# MoodFlow 🌸

**MoodFlow** is a minimal, terminal-based mindfulness tool built in Python. It helps users practice emotional awareness by logging their "vibes," receiving randomized encouragement, and reflecting on their feelings through short journal entries.

* **Vibe Tracking:** Log your current mood (Happy, Sad, Stressed, etc.).
* **Daily Wisdom:** Receive randomized quotes and actionable self-care advice.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
2.  Clone this repository or download the `moodflow.py` file.
3.  Open your terminal or VS Code.
4.  Run the script using:
    ```bash
    python moodflow.py
    ```

## 🛠️ Built With
* **Python 3**
* **Collections Module:** Uses `Counter` for mood frequency analysis.
* **Random Module:** For dynamic quote and advice selection.

## 📖 What I Learned
Building this project helped me master:
1.  **Nested Dictionaries:** Organizing complex data structures.
2.  **While Loops:** Managing continuous user interaction and program flow.
3.  **Input Handling:** Using `.lower()` and `.strip()` to prevent user-entry errors.
4.  **Logical Branching:** Creating complex "if/else" scenarios to handle different user choices.
